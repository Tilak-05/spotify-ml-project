# 📌 Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a song is popular or not using real-time music popularity metrics. Unlike traditional ML projects that rely on static datasets, this system fetches live data from the Last.fm API, preprocesses it, applies a trained classification model, and provides predictions through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The system demonstrates practical machine learning engineering skills including real-time data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, inference pipeline design, and deployment-ready interface development.

---

## Problem Statement

Music popularity prediction is important for streaming platforms, recommendation systems, and analytics. However, most academic ML projects rely on static datasets, which do not reflect real-time popularity.

This project solves that limitation by:

* Fetching real-time popularity metrics from an external API
* Processing the data into machine learning features
* Training a classification model
* Providing live predictions through a web interface

---

## System Architecture

Pipeline flow:

User Input (Song, Artist)
→ Last.fm API (Real-Time Data)
→ Preprocessing Pipeline
→ Trained Machine Learning Model
→ Prediction Output
→ Streamlit Web Interface

---

## Features Implemented

### Real-Time Data Ingestion

* Integrated Last.fm API using secure API authentication
* Fetches live popularity metrics including:

  * Track listeners
  * Track play count
  * Artist popularity indicators

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

* Feature selection and transformation
* Missing value handling
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Consistent preprocessing for both training and inference

### Machine Learning Model

* Model: Logistic Regression
* Task: Binary classification (Popular vs Not Popular)
* Popularity label defined based on play count threshold
* Model and scaler persisted using joblib for reuse

### Prediction Pipeline

* Loads trained model and scaler
* Fetches real-time data
* Applies preprocessing
* Generates prediction and confidence score

### Interactive Web Interface

* Built using Streamlit
* Allows user input of song and artist
* Displays:

  * Prediction result
  * Confidence score
  * Feature values used

### Software Engineering Practices

* Modular project structure
* Environment-based configuration
* Version control using Git and GitHub
* Separation of training and inference pipelines
=======
This project implements a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** that predicts whether a song will be popular based on its Spotify audio features.
